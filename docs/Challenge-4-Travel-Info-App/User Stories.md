- As a traveller, I would like to be able to add cities/towns to my favourites list so that I could easily access the weather forecast of the places I need and are most relevant to me without having to search for them every time I use this service.

- As a user, I would like to be able to log in (and out) so that I could easily access my saved locations when I need to on any device.
